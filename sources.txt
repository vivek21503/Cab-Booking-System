for axois requests : https://www.positronx.io/react-axios-send-asynchronous-http-post-request-tutorial/


we will take a 1km radius circle and search cabs in it, if no cab found we will do this for 2 km radius circle and so on..
we will do this till 5km and then we say no cab available around you.
0.015060 degrees for 1 km.

for payment and feedback page
if distance between client and destination remains less than 10% we will say: You will be arriving in time mins.

In trips section we will say that payment is pending and will be completed if verified by driver by cash or verified by razorpay which changes the payment_done variable to true.

In trips section only we will take feedback which will be stored in feedback section and will affect the rating of drivers.



app will select drivers on basis of rating and distance from the client.

Quesion: 
How do we get realtime location of driver and how do we display them on map??
location of driver will be updated in map after every 1 min.
we will update the location of driver in map after every 5 mins.
How we will do this we will simply make a marker of driver and update the marker after every change of coordinates of driver.
we will use Fetch hook and update the coordinates of driver and take them from database after every 5 min. -- for this we will use setInterval method.
